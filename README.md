Click "Practice mode" to have a go at spelling the words, or click "Timed mode" to accept the challenge!

# Game screen
## Practice mode
After entering the practice mode, you will hear each of the randomly selected 5 Māori words from the topic you chose being pronounced. Type the correct spelling into the textbox, then hit Enter or click the "Enter" button to submit.

If you get the answer right, you will hear "correct" and move on to the next question. If you get the answer wrong, you will hear "incorrect" and the second letter will be shown. You'll get a second chance to enter the word, and if you still get it wrong, the correct answer will be displayed. During this time you can click the audio button to listen to the word a few times before you click the "NEXT ->" button to move on.

Click on the audio icon as many times as you'd like to listen to the pronunciation being repeated, while having the small choice-box for adjusting the speed of the playback. Click the "Skip" button if you want to skip the question. After answering all 5 questions, you will be directed back to the menu screen.

## Timed mode
After entering the timed mode, you will be spelling words as in the practice mode, however, you're now timed and the score depends on how long you spend on answering each question. There is no "NEXT ->" button and you will move through the five words as fast as you can. Feel free to click the "Skip" button, though no score will be awarded for the word you skip. After answering all 5 questions, you will be directed to the reward screen.

# Reward screen
Here you will be presented a reward screen showing your score out of 100. You can view your result which includes the correct spelling, the correctness, the time you spent and the score you got for each word. Click on the return icon to go back to the topic selection screen, or the home icon to go back to the menu screen.
